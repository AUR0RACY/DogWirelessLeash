# DogWirelessLeash
DogWirelessLeash is aimed to develop a dog collar which can send electric shock to dogs when they are far from their owner. The idea is if the dog is away from the owner for some distance, or the collar's infrared sensor detects that their is some moving objectives near the dog, the collar will send a electric shock to the dog.
